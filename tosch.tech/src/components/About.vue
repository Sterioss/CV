            Hello, my name is Thomas, I'm 22 yo and I'm currently studying
            computer science.<br />Currently I'm in my second year but I've been
            coding before geting here. Even before doing ISN (computer science
            option) in High School. Actually I started beign passionate about
            code in middle school.<br />I'm mostly interested in code but can
            still manage in network and systems.<br /><br />I led multiple teams
            in SCRUM projects so far and learnt from each occurence. Some
            projects were more challenging but most of the time I kept balance
            with my private life.<br />I'm a fast learner when it comes to new
            technology and very interested in refactoring in my own code.<br /><br />Next
            year I'll start doing a Mastery in computer science to complete my
            practical knowledge with complementary theorical knowledge.<br /><br />Thank
            you for reading this resume page.<br />Made with passion.<br /><br />Thomas
